# Enhanced Enforced
Requests are routed to servers based on constraints. 
User inputs a desired CPU utilization and latency (ms). 
Contraints can be entered for a preffered range of acceptable values i.e CPU Pref = 50. Acceptable CPU Range = +-20.
This means that any CPU range between 30 and 70 could possibly be routed to.
